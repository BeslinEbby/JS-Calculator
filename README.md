# Simple Calculator using JavaScript

A simple, responsive web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 🔢 Overview

This project implements a basic calculator that supports arithmetic operations and updates results dynamically. It demonstrates how JavaScripts DOM manipulation and UI logic can be combined to build an interactive utility without external frameworks.

### ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

- Decimal point support

- Clear / reset functionality

- Real-time display update as the user inputs numbers or operations

- Simple, clean UI layout

- Works directly in any modern browser

### 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML5 — for structure and markup

- CSS3 — for styling and layout

- JavaScript (ES6+) — for logic, user input handling, and result computation

### ⚙️ How It Works (Brief)

- script.js listens for button clicks (numbers, operators, decimal, clear, equals)

- Updates the display as per user input, builds the expression string

- On equals (“=”) operation — evaluates the expression and shows result

- Handles decimal numbers and resets correctly when cleared

- Updates UI dynamically without page reload
